## SQLite Sales Search

You're going to implement a series of methods that query a database of 1,000 buyer records and 10,000 sales records.

With the starter code is a SQLite file `sales.sqlite` that contains the data. 

### Department Total

The `department_total` method should return the total sales in `dept`.



### Department Total By Date

`department_total_by_date` returns the amount sold in a specific department `dept` on date `date`.



### Country Count Date Range

`country_count_date_range` should return the amount sold in a specific country between `start_date` and `end_date`, inclusive.



### Biggest Spender

`biggest_spender` returns a tuple with the first name and last name of whatever buyer has spent the most money.



### Biggest Spenders

`biggest_spenders` returns a list of the top `how_many` spenders in `department`. 

Each element of the list should be a tuple with the first name, last name, and amount; in that order. 

Note on this one. I should return up to `how_many` of the highest spenders. It's possible that there may not be `how_many` spenders in a specific department. It's also possible that there aren't any in which case this method should return an empty list. 

The tester rounds your total amounts to 2 decimals before it checks, so you shouldn't need to worry about rounding issues with floats. 





## Checking Turning In

There is a test file `test_search.py` that you can run to check your work. You can either use the testing framework within VSCode or run `test_search.py` directly. Running that file will run all the tests.

Commit and push to GitHub to turn in. The code will also be unit tested on push. 

You probably want to commit and push at least each time you finish a method.
